# DiceDetector

Description of the project:
	This deep learning project is trying to learn which number is on top of a 10-sided die. For example if the 10-sided die lands on 7, the deeplearning project will be a digit recognition problem in trying to figure out the features of which side is the top side and try to recognize the number 7. The images in this project are RGB channels and not a gray scale image. The link will be given to view the images, since GitHub can only have an uploaded file size of 25 MB.  This problem will have 4 dimensions [number of images, width, height, channels].  I tried solving this problem using a CNN.
